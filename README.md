# Pretty much just a Feedly App

You can use this app (when it's finished) to browse and read Blogs and stuff.

The real value here is, the setup, the tools and the architectural patterns we are trying out here.

## Tools

### Code Gen
SwiftGen

### Continuous Integration
Bitrise
Danger
Swiftlint
Hound

### Actual Code Things

Use a separate `UIApplicationDelegate` for testing.

Actually write some tests.

Use coordinators, to manage your view controllers.

Turn on all the warnings.
